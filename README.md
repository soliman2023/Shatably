# Shtably App
This is my Graduation Project which is and ambitious project aimed at the category of un organized workers and house owners. and i Created the Back-End for Both Mobile Application and Web Site.

## Project Overview:
The Application idea is to connect the unorganized employees (ex: electrican, plumbers ...etc) with the house owners (clients) so the clients (which are the house owners) and shop owners can hire any of the freelance workers. Also, we added an option which enables the workers and house owners to buy any product they need from a bulid-in store which we created inside our application which enabled us to connect both clients and workers with industrial strores and companies. The goal was to create a robust and scalable backend system that supports the functionality of both the mobile app and the website, ensuring seamless user experience and efficient data management.

## Objective:
Develop a scalable and secure backend system along with an efficient database structure to support the functionality of the Graduation Project mobile application. The backend should handle user authentication, data storage, real-time communication, and integration with third-party services.
